Users can create their own room to play a game in with a friend. This works with the Socket.io room feature.

```

### Chat
Within the room, players can chat with each other. The chat will only be send within that room
```js
io.to(`room-${data.gameID}`).emit('message', data.input)
```

### Map creator
Each room will generate an unique bomberman playing field for that single room. This is generated by the server and sent to the users via the socket.
