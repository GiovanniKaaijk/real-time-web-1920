# Real time web

A 1v1 multiplayer bomberman game created with Socket.io where 2 users can create a room to play a game of bomberman against each other. They have the ability to chat while playing.

## Features

### Rooms
Users can create their own room to play a game in with a friend. This works with the Socket.io room feature.
```js
socket.join(`room-` + gameID)
```

### Chat
Within the room, players can chat with each other. The chat will only be send within that room
```js
io.to(`room-${data.gameID}`).emit('message', data.input)
```

### Twitter API
By streaming from the Twitter API, I keep track of incoming tweets. When a new tweet with the keyword bomb is being posted, a random bomb spawns within the playing field in every room.
```js
client.stream('statuses/filter', {track: 'bomb'}, function(stream) {
    stream.on('data', function(event) {
        console.log(event.text);
        if(event.text !== undefined) {
        console.log(event.text);
        if(lastTweet !== event.text) {
            io.emit('randombomb', ['bomb', 'random',  Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1, Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1])
        }
        lastTweet = event.text
        }
    });
});
```

### Map creator
Each room will generate an unique bomberman playing field for that single room. This is generated by the server and sent to the users via the socket.
